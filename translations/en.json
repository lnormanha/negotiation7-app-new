  "tutorialText": "The Negotiation 7.0 methodology is a complete information system that assists in the three stages of the negotiation process: preparation (before), execution (during) and control (after).\n\nThe negotiator answers questions asked by the Negotiation 7.0 APP. These questions help guide the 7 Steps of the Negotiation 7.0 Methodology and the system generates the negotiation support report that is emailed to the negotiator.\n\nAt the time of execution the negotiator uses this system generated report which serves as an information base and place for noting the most important points. After the negotiation, in the control phase, the negotiator can evaluate the execution by comparing the planned with the executed, and keep the history of all the negotiations made.",
